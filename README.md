# nadar-4-native

This project is the result of the hackaton BNF (2 days), organised with Sup de Création school and the Wild Code School.
Our team won the Jury's prize.

## Theme

The new exhibition 'Nadar' begins at the BNF in october 2018 (French National Library). The students have to propose a digital experience copmlementary to this exhibition. 
This solution must attract yound people in the museum.

3 points : 
- present the 3 Nadars and their artistic work
- address young people (who use social media)
- propose an application complementary to the exhibition

## Jury
Yannis Koïkas (BNF)
Yoann Cribier (Wild Code School)
Aymeric Ravet (Sup de Création)

## Team
2 students from Sup de Création, UX design department -> they had 1 month to conceive the project
2 students from the Wild Code School, Javascript training -> Louise Foussat & Christopher Fremond : we had 2 days to develop the most impacting part of the project

## Concept developped by the students of SUp de Création
- emotional and adaptive experience
  - before the exhibition : stoytelling and information. Create 3 twitter account for the 3 Nadar. They moke each others and have a little competition to determine who's the best. Use this humoristic dialogue to pass some information about the exhibition, and to generate some virality around the exhibition on social media
  - during the exhibition : QR codes are installed near some artistic works. Visitors can scan it with an application made for the exhibition. When they scan a QR code, a little animation plays, and an adecdote about the artistic work associated to the QR code is deblocked into a gallery page. 
  - after the exhibition : the visitiors can take a special selfie into the application, with an old fashion filter, and propose it to the museum. A competition would decide which selfie is the best, and it would be exposed with the Nadar work at the BNF. The winner would be the 4rth Nadar.

## Guidelines for developpers

- Take note of the project conceived by the other students -> advise them on the developpement part
- Discover and handle React Native technology
- Incoporate the design made by the students from Sup de création
- Develop the most impacting part of the UX experience -> the part during the exhibition
- Deliver a complete demo of this part : one picture (Sarah Bernartd) in the gallery is blocked. The demo consist on deblocking it. The jury can click on the QR code on the home page -> an animation begins -> at the end of the animation, the user is redirected on the gallery page, with the picture deblocked, and a modal opened by default with the anecdote written in it.
